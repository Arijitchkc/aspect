 *
 * This group contains all classes, namespaces and functions that have to do

 * and many other parameters depend on pressure, temperature, and/or position within
 * the fluid.

/**
 * @defgroup GeometryModels Describing the properties of the domain
 *
 * A module for the definition of properties of the geometry. This 
 * primarily includes the definition of the shape of the domain
 * (e.g. whether it is a full spherical shell, a quadrant/octant,
 * a description of the geoid, etc. The classes and functions of this
 * module also describe which kinds of boundary conditions hold on
 * the different parts of the boundary of the geometry.
