<li> New: A mesh refinement plugin that allows to set regions of minimum and 
maximum refinement based on specific values of variables (of e.g. temperature) between two 
isosurfaces of that value. For example the minimum refinement is 2 and maximum refinement 
is 4 if the temperature is between 273 K and 1600 K.
