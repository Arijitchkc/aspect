Changed: The multicomponent and multicomponent_compressible material
models now treat the compositional field values as mass fractions, and use
these mass fractions to calculate material properties. The specific heat
is arithmetically averaged according to mass fraction, while the density,
compressibility, thermal expansivity, and thermal conductivity are
all arithmetically averaged according to volume. With the exception of
thermal conductivity, these choices are dictated by mass conservation
and thermodynamics. Viscosity is averaged according to volume fractions,
with the scheme chosen by the user (this functionality has not changed).
These changes will probably not be noticeable for model runs using
compositional fields with values of either 1 or 0 or materials with
the same densities, but significant differences may be seen for models
using distinct material properties. If users have used the
compute_volume_fractions function in utilities, they should be aware that
the function has been renamed compute_fractions_from_compositional_fields.
