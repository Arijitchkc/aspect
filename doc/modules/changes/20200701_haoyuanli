New: Added function phase_average_value, namespace PhaseUtilities to namespace MaterialModel::MaterialUtilities.
This new function averages parameters(e.g density, viscosity) across all phases for a composition. It
takes parameters of phases and values of gamma functions as inputs, applys an arithmetic or 
logarithmic averaging and return the averaged value. A enum type PhaseUtilities::PhaseAveragingOperation 
is defined to determine the type of operation(e.g arithmetic, logarithmic) to perform in the phase_average_value
function.
