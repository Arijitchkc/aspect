New:
1. The lower and upper limits of temperature of phase transitions.
Phase transitions could be actived within a temperature range, and deactived outside.
2. The implementation of the phase functions are updated such that change of values is
take as the differences between the next phase and the current phase, instead of the
differences between adjacent phases.
This feature comes with 4 tests for different compositions:
pyrolite: $ASPECT_SOURCE_DIR/tests/visco_plastic_phases_pyrolite.prm
pyrolite, complicated: $ASPECT_SOURCE_DIR/tests/visco_plastic_phases_pyrolite_complicated.prm
harzburgite: $ASPECT_SOURCE_DIR/tests/visco_plastic_phases_harzburgite.prm
basalt: $ASPECT_SOURCE_DIR/tests/visco_plastic_phases_basalt.prm
