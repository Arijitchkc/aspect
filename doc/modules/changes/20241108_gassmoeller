Fixed: Several fixes for the Newton solver that would slow down convergence or
rarely lead to wrong results. The Newton solver and defect correction Picard
solver computed a wrong pressure scaling for the linear solver. This has been
fixed, leading to a reduction in linear solver iterations. The solution
variable temporarily contained the update to the solution when using the Newton
solver or defect correction Picard solver, leading to bugs in models that
assumed the vector contains the values. This has been fixed by always storing
the values of the solution in the variable and never the update. The
Eisenstat-Walker method to compute linear solver tolerances for the Newton
solver would compute too coarse linear residuals leading to poor nonlinear
convergence. This has been fixed.
