 Fixed: The function to determine whether a boundary is an inflow
or outflow boundary (for the purpose of deciding whether to apply
boundary conditions for compositional fields) did not take into
account the mesh deformation. This caused incorrectly applied
surface boundary conditions in models with free surface and is
fixed now.
