New: I added a "Domain of points sampling method" parameter entry in the 
gravity_point_values postprocessor which allows to select either equiangular 
or spiral equidistant sampling. 
This required to rename the sampling scheme "uniform distribution" 
by "domain of points" simply because the initially so-called 
uniform distribution was not uniform at all, but already equiangular. 
The domain of point spiral sampling method is based on the fibonacci suit
and required a number of points where gravity is calculated 
("Number points spiral sampling method" in the input file) rather than 
the number points of longitude and latitude.
