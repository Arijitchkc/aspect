New: I added a Fibonacci spiral sampling scheme which produces a  
uniformly distributed map. It can only be used for global sampling. 
This spiral sampling scheme is based on the fibonacci suit and it 
requires a total number of points where gravity is calculated 
("Number points spiral sampling scheme" in the input file) 
rather than the separate number points of longitude and latitude
used for the default non-uniform map sampling scheme.
