Changed: The internal pressure scaling of ASPECT no longer uses the 'reference
viscosity' provided by the material model as a representative viscosity.
Instead it computes the representative viscosity as an average of the logarithm
of the actual viscosities present in the model.  This prevents accidental
misconfigurations when the reference viscosity is vastly different from the
actual viscosities or when viscosities change drastically during a model run.
The 'reference_viscosity' function in the material models is now largely
ignored and will be removed in a future release.
