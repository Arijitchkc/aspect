# Contributing to ASPECT's development

To end this section, let us repeat something already stated in the
introduction:

<div class="center">

Let us assume you found something in ASPECT to
improve, something you did not understand, or something that is simply wrong.
Do something about it! No matter whether you are a C++ expert or first-time
user, there are no such things as too-unimportant contributions, and if you
struggled with something, it is most likely somebody else will as well. The
process of contributing to a new project can be daunting, but we appreciate
every contribution and are happy to work with you on improving <span
ASPECT. To get you started we have collected a set of
guidelines and advice on how to get involved in the community. To avoid
duplication we store these guidelines in a separate file [CONTRIBUTING.md][]
in the main folder of the repository, and you can also access them online at
<https://github.com/geodynamics/aspect/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>. Even if
something in that file is not clear, this is an opportunity for you to ask
your question on the forum (see {ref}`sec:2][], and let us know that file
needs improvement.
