when computing the CFL number, compute it with the shortest edge length
instead of the cell diameter

Rename artificial viscosity stability parameter from beta to alpha to match
the paper.



Topics for an ASPECT II paper:

- Compressibility
- Nonlinearity
- Checkpoint/restart
- Mesh refinement criteria
- How implicit to be?




Topics for preview release:
---------------------------
- Implicit time stepping

- temperature equation must contain adiabatic terms in the compressible case
- look at parameterization of geometry and initial temperature field
- Documentation
- Refinement criterion in 3d?
- Attach a proper license and adjust headers of all files

First release
-------------
- Nonlinearity
- Real 3d
- Better mesh?
