when computing the CFL number, compute it with the shortest edge length
instead of the cell diameter

treat artificial diffusion implicitly if this yields a significantly larger
time step

Rename artificial viscosity stability parameter from beta to alpha to match
the paper.

Consider making the convection term u* grad T* semi implicit by writing it
as u* grad T instead. This could lead to less restrictions for the time step
size.
