# A test for the exact Peierls creep flow law
# with the visco_plastic material model.
# Following the general Peierls creep flow law of Idrissi
# et al. 2016 and assuming a stress of 1.092890e8 Pa (strain rate is 1e-13 s^(-1)), the
# exact viscosity is calculated in python through:
#  import numpy as np
#  A    = 1e6     # Peierls creep prefactor 1/s 1/Pa^2
#  R    = 8.314   # gas constant [J/mol*K]
#  T    = 1073    # temperature [K]
#  sig  = 1.092890e8 # stress [Pa]
#  sigp = 3.8e9   # Peierls creep stress [Pa]
#  E    = 566e3   # Peierls creep activation energy [J/mol]
#  V    = 0       # Peierls creep activation volume
#  P    = 0       # Pressure (Pa)
#  n    = 0       # Peierls creep stress exponent
#  p    = 0.5     # First slide parameter
#  q    = 2       # Second glide parameter
#
#  Strain rate invariant:
#    edot_ii = A*np.power(sig,n)*np.exp(-(E/(R*T))*np.power( (1-np.power((sig/sigp),p) ),q) )
#            = 1.000000e-13
#
#  Viscosity:
#    visc = 0.5*sig/edot_ii = 5.464448e20
#
# The material model should return this viscosity.
# The strain rate invariant (edot_ii) above is manually set in the material
# model subsection.
