# This is a test for the new advection method that advects a
# compositional field with the fluid velocity prescribed by
# Darcy's Law.

# The initial porosity is uniform everywhere, and in the
# center of the model is a blob of 'fluid' and 'solid'.
# The solid has a prescribed x velocity, and so the fluid
# blob should be advected horizontally with the solid and
# vertically as it rises up due to its buoyancy.
