# A test with the visco_plastic material model to ensure
# that the multicomponent_incompressible EOS module
# uses the adiabatic temperature to compute density when
# adiabatic heating is turned on. The formula specified
# in this test follows the Extended Boussinesq approximation.
# The initial (constant) temperature throughout the model
# has the same value as the Adiabatic surface temperature.
# As a result, the density at the top (surface) of the model
# should  be equal to the background value specified in the 
# material model (3300):
#   density = background_density * ( 1 - thermal_expansivity * (temperature - reference_temperature)),
# where the reference_temperature is the adiabatic temperature.
# At the base of the model the density should be higher than at the surface
# due to the increase in adiabatic temperature with depth, while the temperature
# within the model is constant. The fact that the temperature does not deviate
# from the initial (1573 K) constant value reflects there are no internal 
# perturbations or boundary conditions that drive deformation within the model.
# As the adiabatic heating terms are scaled with velocity, the temperature within
# the model remains constant although the density still reflects the initial
# adiabatic temperature profile. Notably, if one were to use an adiabatic profile 
# for the intial temperature the density would be constant with depth.
