# This test is used to check if the adiabatic heating
# is calculated correctly.
# The material is upwelling with a constant velocity
# and without conduction of heat, so that the steady state
# of the model is an adiabatic temperature profile, and
# the temperature should not change over time.

# At the top, we define the number of space dimensions we would like to
# work in:
set Dimension                              = 2
set Output directory                       = adiabatic_plate_cooling
set Use years in output instead of seconds = true
set End time                               = 1.
set Pressure normalization                 = no
set Surface pressure                       = 0
# set Adiabatic surface temperature          = 1000   # 1450Â°C adiabat


# Then come a number of sections that deal with the setup
# of the problem to solve. The first one deals with the
# geometry of the domain within which we want to solve.
# The sections that follow all have the same basic setup
# where we select the name of a particular model (here,
# the box geometry) and then, in a further subsection,
# set the parameters that are specific to this particular
# model.

# The final part is to specify what ASPECT should do with the
# solution once computed at the end of every time step. The
# process of evaluating the solution is called `postprocessing'
# and we choose to compute velocity and temperature statistics,
# statistics about the heat flux through the boundaries of the
# domain, and to generate graphical output files for later
# visualization. These output files are created every time
# a time step crosses time points separated by 0.01. Given
# our start time (zero) and final time (0.5) this means that
# we will obtain 50 output files.
