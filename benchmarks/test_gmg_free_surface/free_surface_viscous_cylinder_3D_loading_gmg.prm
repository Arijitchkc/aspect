# This model applies a surface load (using the traction
# boundary condition) on a free surface overlying
# a viscous box. It approximates the analytical solution
# of Haskell (1935a) for an instantaneously applied
# axisymmetric cylindrical load over a viscous half-space.

# This is done by using the viscoelastic model and
# setting a high shear modulus, which produces viscous behavior.
