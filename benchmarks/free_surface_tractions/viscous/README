Benchmark of infinite viscous half-space loaded/unloaded by an
 axisymmetric cylinder, using the solution of: Haskell, N.A.,
 The Motion of a Viscous Fluid Under a Surface Load (1935), Physics
 6, 265; doi:10.1063/1.1745329

The benchmark compares his solution for the surface displacement
 following the application of an instantaneous cylindrical surface
 load (Eq. 3.34) with the deformation of the free surface in ASPECT
 after imposing surface boundary tractions.

A surface pressure of rho_l*g*H0 (where rho_l is the load density,
 H0 is the load height) is applied on the surface for r<r0 (where
 r0 is the load radius), for t>0. This is done both in a 2-D and 
 3-D geometry (by symmetry the load is centered on the left boundary
 or left/front corner). The input files are: 
   'free_surface_viscous_cylinder_2D_loading.prm'
   'free_surface_viscous_cylinder_3D_loading.prm'

Over long timescales, the surface deformation beneath the load (i.e.
 ice sheet) should converge to H0*rho_l/rho_s, where rho_s is the
 density of the medium (i.e. mantle). The deformation outside the
 load should converge to zero. The numerical runs have slightly
 smaller deformations due to the pressure from the far vertical (right)
 boundary, this effect is lessened by increasing the horizontal domain
 size.

The 'topography' output files may be compared against an analytical
 solution by running the script '../viscoelastic/compare_VE_soln.py',
 which outputs the viscous limit of the Nakiboglu and Lambeck (1982)
 solution for an instantaneous cylindrical load on an infinite half-
 space. These outputs ('soln_XX.txt') may be compared against the
 ASPECT 'topography' output files, using the provided gnuplot script
 ('compare_viscous_def.gnuplot' for maximum surface deflection
 through time, 'compare_viscous_def_profile.gnuplot' for deflection
 of profile through time).
