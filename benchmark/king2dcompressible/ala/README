This folder contains input files for the King et al. 2010 benchmark
"A community benchmark for 2-D Cartesian compressible convection
in the Earthâ€™s mantle". 
This includes versions for the ALA and TALA approximations for 
different values of the Dissipation number Di and the Rayleight 
number Ra. The complete input file can be found in 'ala.prm'. 
All other input files only contain the modifications necessary 
ro run cases with a different approximation or values of Di and Ra, 
and the files can be combined using cat, for example

  cat ala.prm tala.prm ala_Di05_Ra5.prm | ./aspect --

to run a model with the TALA approximation, Di=0.5 and Ra=10^5. 

The bash script 'get_statistics' can copy the relevant statistics
of one or several model runs to the screen output and a separate
file. It takes one or several paths to a number of statistics 
files as input.
