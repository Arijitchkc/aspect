ASPECT - Advanced Solver for Problems in Earth's ConvecTion
===========================================================


About
-----

ASPECT is a code to simulate problems in thermal convection. The project is
supported by CIG (http://geodynamics.org).



Installation instructions
-------------------------

The steps to install the necessary dependencies and ASPECT itself is described in the Installation instructions section of the ASPECT [manual](http://www.math.clemson.edu/~heister/manual.pdf).



Running and extending ASPECT
----------------------------

Instructions on how to run and extend, as well as on how to interpret the output of ASPECT can also be found in the ASPECT [manual](http://www.math.clemson.edu/~heister/manual.pdf). This manual also discusses the structure of the source code.
